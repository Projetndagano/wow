    <span>About Us</span>
    The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is a non-governmental, science-based conservation organization 
    that works in over 50 countries around the world. Founded in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society, its mission is to 
    conserve wildlife and ecosystems by generating and applying innovative scientific and field-based solutions to critical problems.
    
    The WCS approach to conservation is rooted in our belief that good conservation requires a sound 
    understanding of the ecology and threats to conservation targets. Our credibility is established through scientific work, 
    which acts as a basis for the development of conservation plans that will work in the real world.

    The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has an objective to commit to conserving some of the most important landscapes 
    around the World that contain at least 25% of the Worldâ€™s biodiversity. In many landscapes it is the large bodied species that are 
    keystone herbivores or predators that are most threatened by human impacts because much of their activities occur at the same scale 
    as people and because they tend to occur at low density and need large areas of land to maintain viable populations. WCS is well known 
    around the world for using science to better understand the needs of these landscape species and to then apply this understanding 
    to ensure the conservation of these species.

    Uganda is one of the most biodiverse countries in Africa and is also rich in the numbers of these landscape species.We have programs 
    that focus on many different species as a result and in particular have studied and conserved:
    
    1. Lions and other large carnivores
    
    2. Elephants
    
    3. Mountain gorillas 
    
    4. Chimpanzees
    
    5. Vultures
    
    6. Crocodiles
    
    7.The rich biodiversity of endemic and threatened species of the Albertine Rift in  particular
    
    Our focus in Uganda is to better understand the ecological needs of these species, what is causing their populations to decline where they 
    are and to then work with local people and the Uganda 
    government to develop solutions to halt the decline and rebuild populations again. Uganda is a country that has gone 
    through terrible civil wars which led to the decimation of its wildlife in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However,it is also a country 
    that can encourage other nations in Africa in that its wildlife populations are recovering and in some sites reaching their pre-war numbers. 
    It is a place that gives hope that these landscape can recover if protected even after terrible losses of wildlife. </b> </br>
